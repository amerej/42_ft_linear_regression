# 42_ft_linear_regression
The aim of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.  

For this project, you will have to create a program that predicts the price of a car by using a [linear function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_function) train with a [gradient descent algortithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent).
